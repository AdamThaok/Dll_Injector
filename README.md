# Manual DLL Injector üöÄ

Welcome to the Manual DLL Injector ‚Äî a lightweight tool that manually maps a DLL into a target process without using LoadLibrary!

This project recreates part of the Windows loader's behavior by parsing PE headers, fixing relocations, handling TLS callbacks, and resolving imports ‚Äî completely manually.

---

## ‚úÖ Status: Fully working and ready for use!

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Find a target process by its name.
- Read a DLL file directly from disk.
- Parse the full PE structure (DOS Header, NT Headers, Sections).
- Allocate memory inside the target process manually.
- Map each section (.text, .data, .reloc, etc.) to the correct location.
- Fix relocations when the base address doesn't match.
- Handle TLS callbacks (Thread Local Storage).
- Resolve the Import Address Table (IAT) manually.
- No LoadLibrary or remote thread creation ‚Äî everything is custom and controlled.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. Find the target process by name using `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot`.
2. Read the DLL from disk into a local memory buffer.
3. Allocate executable memory inside the target process with `VirtualAllocEx`.
4. Copy each section from the local buffer into the allocated memory.
5. Apply relocations if the base address has changed.
6. Handle TLS callbacks (coming soon).
7. Resolve imports manually (coming soon).

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
ManualMapper.exe [TargetProcessName.exe] [YourDll.dll]
```

**Example:**

```
